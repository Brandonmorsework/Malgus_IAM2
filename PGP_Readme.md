## Warning: Use of this provider will result in secrets being in terraform state in PLAIN TEXT (aka NOT ENCRYPTED). You've been warned.

***There are use cases and situations where you need full access to all values generated within terraform, unfortunately there are some resources that force you to provide a PGP key and it will only encrypt and store those values, then manual commands must be run to decrypt.***

***This provider allows you to generate a PGP or use an existing one, from there it provides encrypt and decrypt data sources to allow you to get access to the data.**

## Rationale for Using Pre-Built PGP Provider in Terraform

### Purpose of PGP

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a widely used cryptographic system that provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for digital communications. It is commonly employed to secure email and file transfers, as well as generate digital signatures.

### Benefits of Using Pre-Built PGP Provider

Utilizing a pre-built PGP provider like `ekristen\/pgp` within Terraform offers several advantages over manually creating and managing PGP keys:

**Convenience:** Pre-built PGP providers offer a convenient approach to obtaining and managing PGP keys without the need for manual generation and storage.

**Reliability:** Pre-built PGP providers are typically operated by reputable organizations that adhere to stringent security standards, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the provided PGP keys.

**Scalability:** Pre-built PGP providers can handle multiple PGP keys and users, making them suitable for large-scale deployments.

**Terraform Integration:** Pre-built PGP providers like `ekristen\/pgp` are designed to seamlessly integrate with Terraform, enabling you to manage PGP keys directly within your Terraform infrastructure.

### Comparison with Creating Your Own PGP Key Pair

While generating your own PGP key pair offers greater control over the key generation process, it also involves additional steps and considerations:

* **Key Generation:** Generating a strong, random PGP key pair requires the use of appropriate cryptographic tools.
* **Key Management:** Secure storage and management of the private key is essential to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Key Distribution:** Distributing the public key to authorized users is necessary for secure communication.

In most cases, employing a pre-built PGP provider like `ekristen\/pgp` strikes a balance between convenience, reliability, and security, making it a suitable choice for securing Terraform infrastructure and communications.
